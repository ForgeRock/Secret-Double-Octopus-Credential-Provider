Octopus Authentication Module
============

Octopus Authentication is a high-assurance, passwordless authentication system engineered to address the diverse authentication needs of a real-world, working enterprise.

Octopus Authentication replaces all employee passwords with a strong, password-free authentication mechanism. Our proprietary Windows Credential Provider works in conjunction with standard Active Directory interfaces to seamlessly deliver a stronger, more secure alternative to passwords.

A direct effect of eliminating passwords with the Octopus Authentication Module is a significant increase in security of AD domains, edge devices and remotely accessed services. Moreover, user experience becomes standardized, resulting in enhanced productivity and accessibility, and password management and support costs are dramatically lowered.

As part of the integration with ForgeRock, Secret Double Octopus allows users to choose the orgeRock Authenticator app as an additional multifactor authentication method.

Integrating the Corporate Active Directory
------------------------------------------
<a name="IntegratingAD"></a>
Follow the procedure below to integrate your corporate directory with the Octopus Management Console.

**Note**: The procedure uses an Active Directory type example. You can use the same procedure to integrate a ForgeRock directory type by selecting **ForgeRock** in Step 2. The rest of the steps are the same.

**To integrate the corporate Active Directory:**

1.  From the Octopus Management Console, open the **System Settings** menu and select **Directories**.

1.  Click **Add Directory** to open the **Select Directory Type** dialog. **Active Directory** is the default selection.

    If you want directory users to be synced automatically, enable the **Directory Sync** toggle button. When Directory Sync is disabled (as in the example below) you will need to import users manually. (For more information, refer to the Octopus Management Console Admin Guide.)

    <img src=".//media/image14.png" style="width:2.78795in;height:2.57292in" />

1.  Click **Select**.

### Configuring Authentication Policies for the Directory

After integrating your corporate AD, you need to specify instructions about which authentication options and methods are supported for it. The **Policy** tab of the directory settings enables you to configure:

-   **Supported authenticators:** ForgeRock Authenticator can function as a primary or secondary authenticator (or both).

    - **When ForgeRock is a Primary authenticator**, it can work alongside or instead of Octopus Authenticator. If both methods are enabled, users will be able to choose the authenticator they prefer.

    - **When ForgeRock is a Secondary authenticator**, users first authenticate with another authentication method (not ForgeRock). Then, information is sent to ForgeRock for additional authentication. Information that is sent includes user agent, Source IP and the authentication that was used for the primary authenticator.

-   **OTP settings:** To enhance authentication capabilities, Secret Double Octopus provides the option of issuing a one-time password for login. You can enable either or both of these OTP options:

    - **Online OTP:** When enabled, enrolled users can log into Windows, Mac or the User Portal using a one-time password issued by either the Octopus Authenticator or by ForgeRock.

    - **Offline OTP:** When enabled, enrolled users can log into Windows, Mac or the User Portal using a one-time password that is stored locally. These OTPs are supplied by the Octopus Authenticator or by ForgeRock.

**To configure the directoryâ€™s authentication policies**:

1.  From the settings of the directory you just added, open the
    **Policy** tab and scroll to the **Authenticators** section.

1.  From the **Additional Authenticator** dropdown list, select the ForgeRock authenticator. Then select the mapping field that the Octopus Authentication Server will send to ForgeRock as the authentication field (Username, Email, Displayname, etc.).  

    Verify that the **Enable Authenticator as Primary** toggle button is enabled.

    <img src=".//media/image16.png" style="width:4.95208in;height:2.00559in" />

1.  If you want ForgeRock to serve as a further authenticator in addition to other authentication methods (Octopus Authenticator, FIDO, etc.), enable the **Enable Authenticator as Secondary** toggle button.

2.  Scroll down to the **One Time Password (OTP)** section.

    a. To activate online OTP, click the **Enable Online OTP** toggle button. Then, select the appropriate authenticator from the **Online Validator** list. (You can specify either the Octopus Authenticator or the ForgeRock TOTP chain as the OTP validator.)

    b. To activate offline OTP, click the **Enable Offline OTP** toggle button. select the appropriate authenticator from the **Offline Validator** list. (You can specify either the Octopus Authenticator or the ForgeRock TOTP chain as the OTP validator.)

    c. In the **OTP Configuration** section, set the parameters of algorithm, number of digits, time period for replacement of the OTP token, and amount of time for which users are allowed to authenticate offline.

    <img src=".//media/OTPSettings.png" style="width:5.46692in;height:3.3125in" />

1.  At the bottom of the **Policy** tab, click **Save** and then publish your changes.

**Note**: When an additional primary authenticator is selected, that authenticator needs to be selected in the Windows MSI Updater as well. This will allow users to choose that primary authentication method on their Windows workstations.

MSI Deployment of Octopus Authenticator
---------------------------------------
<a name="DeployingMSI"></a>
The following sections explain how to deploy and upgrade using the MSI tool.

### Performing Silent Installation

Silent installation allows administrators to push the installation to
all client machines from a central tool (e.g., GPO). All required
components are installed as part of the deployment.

>**Note:** Administrator permissions are required to run the Octopus Authentication for Windows MSI.

**To perform silent installation:**

1.  Open and run your distributing software.

1.  Open the command prompt as Admin, and run  
    *Octopus Authentication for Windows (64bit or 32bit).msi*

2.  Run *Octopus Authentication for windowsxx.msi /qn*:

    -    Windows 64-bit:  
        *C:\\&gt; Octopus Authentication for Windows64bit â€“ xx\_xxx\_xx.msi
        /qn*

    -    Windows 32-bit:  
        *C:\\&gt; Octopus Authentication for Windows32bit â€“ xx\_xxx\_xx.msi
        /qn*

### Performing MSI Upgrade

**IMPORTANT**: To successfully perform MSI upgrade, the MSI file must have the same filename as that of the original installation. The MSI updater creates an MSI file with the update date in the filename. **This file needs to be renamed to match the name of the original installation file**.

If you try to upgrade using an MSI file that is named differently from the original installation file, the following error message will appear: *Error 1316: The specified account already exists*

This error is an alert that you are trying to install an MSI file that has a different name from the one that is already installed.



If you are not sure of the name of the original installation file, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **C:\Windows\Installer**

1. Open the following file: **SourceHash{F88FAA40-72B9-4CE0-88DA-6592EF361C94}**

2. Search for the name of the file that was used for installation. You will find it at the end of the SourceHash file.

To upgrade the MSI, run the following command:

-   Windows 64-bit:  
    *C:\\&gt; msiexec /I " Octopus Authentication For Windows 64bit.msi" REINSTALL=ALL REINSTALLMODE=vomus IS_MINOR_UPGRADE=1 /qn*

-   Windows 32-bit:  
    *C:\\&gt; msiexec /I " Octopus Authentication For Windows 32bit.msi" REINSTALL=ALL REINSTALLMODE=vomus IS_MINOR_UPGRADE=1 /qn*

Windows ForgeRock Authentication
